    "*Claudette* is a wrapper for Anthropic's [Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SDK works well, but it is quite low level -- it leaves the developer to do a lot of stuff manually. That's a lot of extra work and boilerplate! Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Chat` class that creates stateful dialogs\n",
    "- Support for *prefill*, which tells Claude what to use as the first few words of its response\n",
    "- Convenient image support\n",
    "- Simple and convenient support for Claude's new Tool Use API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to the key provided to you by Anthropic in order to use this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this library is the first ever \"literate nbdev\" project. That means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images, detailed explanations, and teaches *how* and *why* the code is written the way it is. Even if you've never used the Anthropic Python SDK or Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Click [Claudette's Source](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html) to read it, or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to see every step of the creation process in action. The tutorial below includes links to API details which will take you to relevant parts of the source. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is because we take seriously Knuth's call to action, that we have a \"*moral commitment*\" to never write an \"*illiterate program*\" -- and so we have a commitment to making literate programming and easy and pleasant experience. (For more on this, see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX1yGxJijsI) from Hamel Husain.)\n",

    "> \"*Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a **computer** what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to **human beings** what we want a computer to do.*\" Donald E.
