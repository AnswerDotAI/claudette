*Claudette* is a wrapper for Anthropic’s [Python
SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python).

The SDK works well, but it is quite low level – it leaves the developer
to do a lot of stuff manually. That’s a lot of extra work and
boilerplate! Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be
automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:

- A [`Chat`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat)
  class that creates stateful dialogs
- Support for *prefill*, which tells Claude what to use as the first few
  words of its response
- Convenient image support
- Simple and convenient support for Claude’s new Tool Use API.

You’ll need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to the
key provided to you by Anthropic in order to use this library.

Note that this library is the first ever “literate nbdev” project. That
means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter
Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images,
detailed explanations, and teaches *how* and *why* the code is written
the way it is. Even if you’ve never used the Anthropic Python SDK or
Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Click
[Claudette’s Source](https://answerdotai.github.io/claudette/core.html)
to read it, or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to
see every step of the creation process in action. The tutorial below
includes links to API details which will take you to relevant parts of
the source. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is
because we take seriously Knuth’s call to action, that we have a “*moral
commitment*” to never write an “*illiterate program*” – and so we have a
commitment to making literate programming and easy and pleasant
experience. (For more on this, see [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX1yGxJijsI) from Hamel Husain.)

## Install

``` sh
pip install claudette
```

## Getting started

Anthropic’s Python SDK will automatically be installed with Claudette,
if you don’t already have it.

``` python
import os
# os.environ['ANTHROPIC_LOG'] = 'debug'
```

To print every HTTP request and response in full, uncomment the above
line.

``` python
from claudette import *
```

Claudette only exports the symbols that are needed to use the library,
so you can use `import *` to import them. Alternatively, just use:

``` python
import claudette
```

…and then add the prefix `claudette.` to any usages of the module.

Claudette provides `models`, which is a list of models currently
available from the SDK.

``` python
models
```

    ('claude-3-opus-20240229',
     'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
     'claude-3-haiku-20240307')

For these examples, we’ll use Haiku, since it’s fast and cheap (and
surprisingly good!)

``` python
model = models[-1]
```

## Chat

The main interface to Claudia is the
[`Chat`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat) class,
which provides a stateful interface to Claude:

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp="""You are a helpful and concise assistant.""")
chat("I'm Jeremy")
```

It’s nice to meet you, Jeremy! I’m an AI assistant created by Anthropic.
I’m here to help with any questions or tasks you may have. Please let me
know if there’s anything I can assist you with.

- stop_sequence: None
- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 19, ‘output_tokens’: 51}

</details>

``` python
r = chat("What's my name?")
r
```

Your name is Jeremy, as you told me earlier.

- role: assistant
- stop_reason: end_turn
- stop_sequence: None
- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 78, ‘output_tokens’: 14}

</details>

As you see above, displaying the results of a call in a notebook shows
just the message contents, with the other details hidden behind a
collapsible section. Alternatively you can `print` the details:

``` python
print(r)
```

    ToolsBetaMessage(id='msg_01NdJsRQEqmMGRVAhhcX2VX4', content=[TextBlock(text='Your name is Jeremy, as you told me earlier.', type='text')], model='claude-3-haiku-20240307', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=In: 78; Out: 14; Total: 92)

Claude supports adding an extra `assistant` message at the end, which
contains the *prefill* – i.e. the text we want Claude to assume the
response starts with. Let’s try it out:

``` python
chat("Concisely, what is the meaning of life?",
     prefill='According to Douglas Adams,')
```

According to Douglas Adams, “The answer to the ultimate question of
life, the universe, and everything is 42.”

</details>

Instead of calling
[`Chat`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat)
directly, you can use
[`Chat.stream`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat.stream)
to stream the results as soon as they arrive (although you will only see
the gradual generation if you execute the notebook yourself, of course!)

``` python
for o in chat.stream("Concisely, what book was that in?", prefill='It was in'):
    print(o, end='')
```

    It was in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

## Tool use

[Tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use) lets Claude
use external tools.

We use [docments](https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html) to make
defining Python functions as ergonomic as possible. Each parameter (and
the return value) should have a type, and a docments comment with the
description of what it is. As an example we’ll write a simple function
that adds numbers together, and will tell us when it’s being called:

``` python
def sums(
    a:int,  # First thing to sum
    b:int=1 # Second thing to sum
) -> int: # The sum of the inputs
    "Adds a + b."
    print(f"Finding the sum of {a} and {b}")
    return a + b
```

To ensure it gets used, we can use a system prompt:

``` python
sp = "If asked to add things up, use the `sums` function instead of doing it yourself. Never mention what tools you use."
```

We’ll get Claude to add up some long numbers:

``` python
a,b = 604542,6458932
pr = f"What is {a}+{b}?"
pr
```

    'What is 604542+6458932?'

To use tools, pass a list of them to
[`Chat`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat):

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp=sp, tools=[sums])
```

Now when we call that with our prompt, Claude doesn’t return the answer,
but instead returns a `tool_use` message, which means we have to call
the named tool with the provided parameters:

``` python
r = chat(pr)
r
```

ToolUseBlock(id=‘toolu_01Ru65j1Y4fFGYzjdav5zvSg’, input={‘a’: 604542,
‘b’: 6458932}, name=‘sums’, type=‘tool_use’)

<details>

  604542, ‘b’: 6458932}, ‘name’: ‘sums’, ‘type’: ‘tool_use’}\]
- model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
- role: assistant
- stop_reason: tool_use
- stop_sequence: None
- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 418, ‘output_tokens’: 72}

</details>

Claudette handles all that for us – we just have to pass along the
message, and it all happens automatically:

``` python
chat(r)
```

    Finding the sum of 604542 and 6458932

The sum of 604542 and 6458932 is 7063474.

<details>

- id: msg_01NxFT6mAeCYH8xnkRA1ru8V

- role: assistant
- stop_reason: end_turn
- stop_sequence: None
- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 505, ‘output_tokens’: 23}

</details>

You can see how many tokens have been used at any time by checking the
`use` property. Note that (as of May 2024) tool use in Claude uses a
*lot* of tokens, since it automatically adds a large system prompt.

``` python
chat.use
```

    In: 923; Out: 95; Total: 1018

We can do everything needed to use tools in a single step, by using
[`Chat.toolloop`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/toolloop.html#chat.toolloop).
This can even call multiple tools as needed solve a problem. For
example, let’s define a tool to handle multiplication:

``` python
def mults(
    a:int,  # First thing to multiply
    b:int=1 # Second thing to multiply
) -> int: # The product of the inputs
    "Multiplies a * b."
    print(f"Finding the product of {a} and {b}")
    return a * b
```

Now with a single call we can calculate `(a+b)/2` – by passing
`show_trace` we can see each response from Claude in the process:

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp=sp, tools=[sums,mults])
pr = f'Calculate ({a}+{b})*2'
pr
```

    'Calculate (604542+6458932)*2'

``` python
chat.toolloop(pr, show_trace=True)
```

So the final result is 14,126,948.

## Images

Claude can handle image data as well. As everyone knows, when testing
image APIs you have to use a cute puppy.

``` python
fn = Path('samples/puppy.jpg')
display.Image(filename=fn, width=200)
```

![](index_files/figure-commonmark/cell-21-output-1.jpeg)

We create a
[`Chat`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/core.html#chat) object
as before:

``` python
chat = Chat(model)
```

Claudia expects images as a list of bytes, so we read in the file:

``` python
img = fn.read_bytes()
```

Prompts to Claudia can be lists, containing text, images, or both, eg:

``` python
chat([img, "In brief, what color flowers are in this image?"])
```

The image contains purple or lavender-colored flowers, which appear to
be daisies or a similar type of flower.

<details>

- id: msg_017i7Su5rfcdcz3FmiEQ9CvD
- content: \[{‘text’: ‘The image contains purple or lavender-colored
  flowers, which appear to be daisies or a similar type of flower.’,
  ‘type’: ‘text’}\]
- model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
- role: assistant
- stop_reason: end_turn
- stop_sequence: None
- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 185, ‘output_tokens’: 28}

</details>

The image is included as input tokens.

``` python
chat.use
```

    In: 185; Out: 28; Total: 213

Alternatively, Claudette supports creating a multi-stage chat with
separate image and text prompts. For instance, you can pass just the
image as the initial prompt (in which case Claude will make some general
comments about what it sees), and then follow up with questions in
additional prompts:

``` python
chat = Chat(model)
chat(img)
```

The image shows a cute puppy lying in the grass. The puppy appears to be
a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with a fluffy brown and white coat. The
puppy is looking directly at the camera with a friendly, curious
expression. In the background, there are some purple flowers, adding a
nice natural setting to the scene. The image captures the adorable and
playful nature of this young pup.

</details>

``` python
chat('What color is it?')
```

The puppy in the image has a brown and white coat color. It appears to
be a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed, with the characteristic long,
silky fur in those colors.

<details>

- id: msg_01XfDZDRyaNMW58TVJ9znXjR

- type: message
- usage: {‘input_tokens’: 304, ‘output_tokens’: 44}

</details>

Note that the image is passed in again for every input in the dialog, so
that number of input tokens increases quickly with this kind of chat.

``` python
chat.use
```

## XML helpers

*(Most people can probably ignore this section – if you find yourself
using XML a lot and you want a smoother experience, then read on…)*

Claude works well with XML inputs, but XML can be a bit clunky to work
with manually. Therefore, Claudette includes a couple of more
streamlined approaches for XML generation. You don’t need to use these
if you don’t find them useful – you can always just use plain strings
for XML directly.

An XML node contains a tag, optional children, and optional attributes.
[`xt`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#xt) creates
a tuple of these three things, which we will use to general XML shortly.
Attributes are passed as kwargs; since these might conflict with
reserved words in Python, you can optionally add a `_` prefix and it’ll
be stripped off.

``` python
xt('x-custom', ['hi'], _class='bar')
```

    ('x-custom', ['hi'], {'class': 'bar'})

Claudette has functions defined for some common HTML elements to create
[`xt`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#xt) tuples
more easily, including these:

``` python
from claudette.helpers import div,img,h1,h2,p,hr,html
```

``` python
a = html([
    p('This is a paragraph'),
    hr(),
    img(src='http://example.prg'),
    div([
        h1('This is a header'),
        h2('This is a sub-header', style='k:v'),
    ], _class='foo')
])
a
```

    ('html',
     [('p', 'This is a paragraph', {}),
      ('hr', None, {}),
      ('img', None, {'src': 'http://example.prg'}),
      ('div',
       [('h1', 'This is a header', {}),
        ('h2', 'This is a sub-header', {'style': 'k:v'})],
       {'class': 'foo'})],
     {})

To convert a tuple data structure created with
[`xt`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#xt) and
friends into XML, use
[`to_xml`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#to_xml),
adding the `hl` parameter to optionally add syntax highlighting:

``` python
to_xml(a, hl=True)
```

``` xml
<html>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <hr />
  <img src="http://example.prg" />
  <div class="foo">
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2 style="k:v">This is a sub-header</h2>
  </div>
</html>
```

JSON doesn’t map as nicely to XML as the
[`xt`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#xt) data
structure, but for simple XML trees it can be convenient. The
[`json_to_xml`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/claudette/helpers.html#json_to_xml)
function handles that conversion:

``` python
a = dict(surname='Howard', firstnames=['Jeremy','Peter'],
         address=dict(state='Queensland',country='Australia'))
print(json_to_xml(a, 'person'))
```

    <person>
      <surname>Howard</surname>
      <firstnames>
        <item>Jeremy</item>
        <item>Peter</item>
      </firstnames>
      <address>
        <state>Queensland</state>
        <country>Australia</country>
      </address>
    </person>
