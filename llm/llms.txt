# Claudette

> Claudette is a Python library that wraps Anthropic's Claude API to provide a higher-level interface for creating AI applications. It automates common patterns while maintaining full control, offering features like stateful chat, prefill support, image handling, and streamlined tool use.

Things to remember when using Claudette:

- You must set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable with your Anthropic API key
- Claudette is designed to work with Claude 3 models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) and supports multiple providers (Anthropic direct, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex)
- The library provides both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces
- Use `Chat()` for maintaining conversation state and handling tool interactions
- When using tools, the library automatically handles the request/response loop
- Image support is built in but only available on compatible models (not Haiku)
